# sideloading on ios for dummies

# 1. Using TrollStore


0. 16.0-16.6.1, on these versions you can get TrollStore using TrollStar (https://github.com/34306/TrollStar/releases).
Of course, you have to sideload TrollStar first.
If you're on iOS 15, you can use Dopamine jailbreak, and through that install trollstore (https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine/releases)

1. Get an IPA file and you'll have to click the "+" button in TrollStore, select the IPA file and click on "Install".

Boom wow so hard fr!!

# Using Sideloadly

Go to the Sideloadly's website (https://sideloadly.io). 

0. You'll have to install iTunes and iCloud if you are on windows.

1. Once Sideloadly is launched, drag the IPA file into the box where the IPA files should be.

2. Connect your device with a cable and select it in Sideloadly. Input your Apple ID and click on Start. 

It'll take some time but then it will be installed on your device.

# Using ESign

no leaked certs here bro

0. Get a certificate. You can either buy it from Apple or from some other websites.

1. Go to https://gbox.run and click on "Sign GBox". Then you can install GBox.

2. After that import the certificate into GBox and then go to ESign's website (https://esign.yyyue.xyz) and download the IPA.

3. Sign ESign IPA with GBox and install it.

4. Delete GBox :trol:
